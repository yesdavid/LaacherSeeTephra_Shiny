# LaacherSeeTephra_Shiny

LSTbase is a collation - from the literature - of locations at which Laacher See ejecta has been identified.
The data are presented 'as is' with information taken from the published literature. The focus has been strictly on point-like occurrences in the medial and distal fields. For proximal mappings of tephra blankets and PDCs please consult the many publications by the late Hans-Ulrich Schmincke and collaborators. In addition, German soil maps also contain information on such blanket deposits (https://geoportal.bgr.de/mapapps/resources/apps/geoportal/index.html?lang=en#/geoviewer).

Laacher See tephra occurrences are by default assumed to be the result of airfall; in some case - chiefly in relation to deposits along the River Rhine - they are classed as fluvially deposited, however. Please consult the original publications for further information.
Whenever the information is provided in the original publications, section or core labels are given.

Coordinates are provided in WGS84; not all locations are precise.
